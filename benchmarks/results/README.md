# Benchmark results

Store curated benchmark outputs here (CSV/JSON + short narrative notes).

Recommended structure:
- One folder per tool + DBMS + date, e.g.:
  - `rdkit_pg_2026-02-19/`
  - `bingo_sqlite_2026-02-19/`

For each run, include:
- environment description (OS, CPU, RAM, Docker/native)
- exact tool/extension versions
- dataset description (size, source)
- index configuration
- outputs (raw measurements + summary)
